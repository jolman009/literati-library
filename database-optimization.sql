-- WHERE user_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 50;

-- Query 2: Books by Status (Optimized) 
-- Uses: idx_books_user_status_created
-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM books 
-- WHERE user_id = $1 AND status = $2 ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Query 3: Recent Reading Sessions (Optimized)

-- Query 4: Book Notes (Optimized)
-- Uses: idx_notes_book_user
-- EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM notes 
-- WHERE book_id = $1 AND user_id = $2 ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ============================================
-- MATERIALIZED VIEWS FOR STATISTICS
-- ============================================

-- Create materialized view for user reading statistics
-- Refreshed periodically to avoid expensive real-time calculations

-- ============================================
-- MAINTENANCE QUERIES
-- ============================================

-- Refresh materialized views (run periodically)

-- Check index usage (for monitoring)
-- SELECT indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch

-- ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Analyze query performance (for specific queries)
-- EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM books WHERE user_id = $1 ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- ============================================
-- PERFORMANCE MONITORING SETUP
-- ============================================

-- Enable query statistics (if not already enabled)
-- Add to postgresql.conf:
-- shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
-- pg_stat_statements.track = all

-- Query to find slow queries:
-- SELECT query, mean_exec_time, calls, total_exec_time
-- FROM pg_stat_statements
-- WHERE query LIKE '%books%' OR query LIKE '%reading_sessions%'
-- ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC LIMIT 10;

-- ============================================
-- CONNECTION OPTIMIZATION
-- ============================================

-- Recommended connection pool settings for production:
/*
For Supabase/PostgreSQL with typical usage:
- max_connections: 100
- Connection pool size: 20-30 connections
- Connection timeout: 30 seconds
- Idle timeout: 300 seconds
*/

-- ============================================
-- CLEANUP AND MAINTENANCE
-- ============================================

-- Clean up old reading sessions (optional maintenance)
-- DELETE FROM reading_sessions 
-- WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
-- AND duration IS NULL;

-- Vacuum and analyze tables regularly
-- VACUUM ANALYZE books;
-- VACUUM ANALYZE reading_sessions;  
-- VACUUM ANALYZE notes;
