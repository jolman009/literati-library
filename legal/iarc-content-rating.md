- **Apple App Store**: Enter equivalent rating manually (Apple doesn't use IARC)

### 3. Maintain Rating Accuracy

## Important Notes

### User-Uploaded Content Disclaimer

Since Literati allows users to upload books, include this disclaimer in app stores and marketing:

> "Literati is a personal digital library app. Users upload and read their own book files. While the app interface is suitable for all ages, the content of user-uploaded books varies. Users are responsible for ensuring they have legal rights to uploaded materials and that content is age-appropriate for intended readers."

### Future Feature Considerations

If you plan to add these features, you'll need to update the IARC rating:

- **Social Features**: User profiles, sharing, comments → Requires "User Interaction" rating
- **In-App Purchases**: Premium features, subscriptions → Requires purchase disclosure
- **Advertising**: Third-party ads → Requires ad disclosure and potentially higher age rating
- **Public Libraries**: Book sharing between users → Requires content moderation

### Annual Maintenance

- **Review Date**: October 3, 2026 (one year from today)
- **Action**: Review questionnaire responses for continued accuracy
- **Update If**: Any features have changed that affect content ratings
