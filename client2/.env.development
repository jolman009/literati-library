# Authentication Strategy for Development
# Set to 'true' ONLY if you need header-based auth for cross-origin dev testing
# (e.g., testing from phone/tablet connecting to localhost)
# Leave 'false' to use HttpOnly cookies (RECOMMENDED for local development)
# HttpOnly cookies provide better security and work seamlessly with localhost
