## 8. Known Issues & Missing Features

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Implementation
1. **Daily Login Tracking**: No automatic tracking on user login
   - Recommended: Add to AuthContext on successful login

2. **Book Completion Tracking**: No explicit book completion event
   - Recommended: Add tracking when user marks book as finished or reads final page

3. **Highlight Creation**: Cannot find highlight tracking implementation
   - Recommended: Add to BookNotesSystem or ReadBookEnhanced when highlights are saved

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Verification
1. **Reading Time Tracking**: Verify 1 point per minute is calculated correctly
2. **Time-Based Achievements**: Early Bird and Night Owl achievements may need session time tracking
3. **Speed Reader Achievement**: Requires tracking pages per session
4. **Marathon Reader Achievement**: Requires tracking session duration

## 10. Debugging Tips

### Console Logs to Watch For
```
‚úÖ Book upload tracked successfully - 25 points awarded
‚úÖ Reading session start tracked - 5 points awarded
‚úÖ X page(s) tracked - X point(s) awarded
‚úÖ Reading session completed tracked - 10 points + X minutes
‚úÖ Note creation tracked - 15 points awarded
‚úÖ Daily check-in complete! +10 points earned!
üìä Calculated reading streak: X days
üèÜ Achievement unlocked: [Achievement Name]
```

### localStorage Keys to Inspect
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.getItem('gamification_stats_[userId]')
localStorage.getItem('gamification_achievements_[userId]')
localStorage.getItem('active_reading_session')
localStorage.getItem('readingSessionHistory')
localStorage.getItem('lastDailyCheckIn')
localStorage.getItem('checkInStreak')
```

### Common Issues
1. **Points not awarded**: Check console for tracking errors
2. **Achievements not unlocking**: Verify stats are updating correctly
3. **Streaks not calculating**: Check session history and dates
4. **Duplicate points**: Clear localStorage and retest
