## ⏳ In Progress

### Digital Asset Links Deployment
**Status**: Committed and pushed, waiting for Vercel cache to update

**Why it's taking time:**
- Vercel has CDN caching (indicated by `X-Vercel-Cache: HIT`)
- Cache headers show: `Age: 21640` seconds (old cache)
- New deployment needs to propagate through CDN edge nodes

**ETA**: 2-10 minutes more

**How to verify when ready:**
```bash
curl https://literati.pro/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

Should return:
```json
[{
  "relation": ["delegate_permission/common.handle_all_urls"],
  "target": {
    "namespace": "android_app",
    "package_name": "app.literati.pro",
    "sha256_cert_fingerprints": ["BA:AA:BD:5C:06:C0:CC:17:F8:20:AA:5E:1E:BE:A2:2A:A3:5C:26:C8:20:67:68:95:45:F0:61:A0:13:4D:53:40"]
  }
}]
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (You Can Do Now!)

### Step 1: Build Your Android App (Don't wait for deployment!)

You can build your app RIGHT NOW while waiting for the Digital Asset Links to propagate:

```cmd
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

**Build time**: ~2-5 minutes
**Output**: `android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk`

**What happens during build:**
- Compiles your TWA wrapper
- Signs with your keystore (will prompt for password)
- Optimizes with ProGuard/R8
- Creates installable APK

### Step 2: Test on Device (Optional - can do now)

Install the APK on your Android device:

```cmd
adb devices  # Check device is connected
adb install android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk
```

**What to test:**
- ✅ App installs successfully
- ✅ App opens (should show literati.pro)
- ⚠️ TWA mode may not work yet (browser UI might show)
  - This is expected until Digital Asset Links propagate
  - Once assetlinks.json is accessible, TWA will activate automatically

### Step 3: Build AAB for Play Store (Recommended)

While you're building, also create the AAB (Android App Bundle):

```cmd
cd android
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output**: `android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab`

**Why AAB?**
- Google Play Store requires AAB (not APK) for new apps
- Smaller download sizes for users
- Automatic optimization for different devices

## 🔐 Important Security Reminders

### Files to NEVER Commit to Git:
- ✅ `android/literati-release.keystore` (already in android submodule)
- ✅ `android/gradle.properties` (contains passwords)
- ✅ Any file with passwords or secrets

### Files Already Committed (Safe):
- ✅ `client2/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json` (public information)
- ✅ `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (public configuration)
- ✅ `android/app/build.gradle` (public configuration)

### Backup Checklist:
- [ ] Copy `android/literati-release.keystore` to external drive
- [ ] Save keystore password in password manager
- [ ] Store SHA256 in secure notes
- [ ] Keep backup of `gradle.properties`

---

## 🧪 Verification Commands

### Check Digital Asset Links (run periodically):
```bash
curl https://literati.pro/.well-known/assetlinks.json
```

### Test with Google's Tool (once accessible):
Visit: https://developers.google.com/digital-asset-links/tools/generator

Enter:
- **Site**: `literati.pro`
- **Package**: `app.literati.pro`
- **SHA256**: `BA:AA:BD:5C:06:C0:CC:17:F8:20:AA:5E:1E:BE:A2:2A:A3:5C:26:C8:20:67:68:95:45:F0:61:A0:13:4D:53:40`

Should show: ✅ Verification successful

### Check Android Build:
```cmd
cd android
.\gradlew tasks --all | findstr "assemble"
```

Should show available build tasks.

## 📱 What Happens After Digital Asset Links Deploy

1. **Automatic TWA Activation**
   - Android will cache the verification
   - Apps using your keystore will open URLs in TWA mode
   - No browser UI, full app experience

2. **Deep Linking Works**
   - Tapping literati.pro links opens your app
   - Share target for PDFs/EPUBs works
   - System integration complete

3. **Play Store Approval**
   - Google verifies Digital Asset Links during review
   - Must be accessible at time of submission
   - Verification happens automatically

✅ Updated all configuration files

**What's left:**
⏳ Wait 10 more minutes for CDN propagation
🚀 Build your app (5 minutes)
📱 Test on device (10 minutes)
🏪 Submit to Play Store (tomorrow)

## 🆘 If You Need Help

### Digital Asset Links Still Not Working After 30 Min:
1. Check GitHub Actions: https://github.com/jolman009/literati-library/actions
2. Verify file exists in repo: Check `client2/public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`
3. Clear Vercel cache: Use Vercel dashboard or CLI
4. Contact me for troubleshooting

### Build Fails:
1. Check `android/gradle.properties` has your passwords
2. Verify keystore file exists: `android/literati-release.keystore`
3. Ensure you're in the `android` folder when running gradlew
4. Check Java keytool is accessible

### TWA Doesn't Work After Install:
1. This is NORMAL until Digital Asset Links propagate
2. Wait 24-48 hours for Google's cache to update
3. Uninstall and reinstall after links are verified
4. Test with Google's verification tool first
