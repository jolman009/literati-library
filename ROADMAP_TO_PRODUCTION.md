  1. Security Hardening 🔒

  Most Critical: JWT security improvements and API protection
  - Implement refresh token rotation
  - Add token blacklisting on logout
  - Set secure httpOnly cookies for tokens
  - Add password strength validation
  - Implement account lockout after failed attempts

  2. Testing Infrastructure 🧪

  High Impact: Set up comprehensive test suite
  - Configure Vitest for unit testing
  - Write component unit tests (target 80% coverage)
  - Write API endpoint tests
  - Set up Playwright E2E tests

  3. Collections Page Completion 📚

  User-Facing Priority: Complete missing functionality
  - Add book search and filtering
  - Implement book metadata editing
  - Add bulk book operations

  4. Production Deployment Setup ☁️

  Infrastructure: Prepare for hosting
  - Choose hosting platform (Railway, Render, AWS, Azure)
  - Set up production environment variables
  - Configure CI/CD pipeline

  💡 My Recommendation

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Strategic Priority: Since security vulnerabilities can block
  production deployment entirely, I recommend starting with
  Security Hardening first. This includes fixing the JWT
  audience validation we discovered during testing, which is
  already affecting the application's functionality.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Suggested Next Task: JWT Security Hardening - specifically
  fixing the audience validation issues we found and
  implementing secure token management.

  Which of these priorities would you like to tackle next? I
  recommend starting with the JWT security improvements since
  we already identified specific issues that need addressing
