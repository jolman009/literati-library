    ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Advanced Password Security goes beyond basic complexity requirements by incorporating real-world threat
  intelligence, user behavior analysis, and breach database checking to provide enterprise-grade password
  protection.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  ✅ Completed: Advanced Password Strength Validation

  Enhanced Security Features:

  1. Comprehensive Strength Scoring (7-point system):
  - ✅ Length requirements (8+ characters, bonus for 12+)
  - ✅ Character complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
  - ✅ Character entropy analysis (unique character variety)
  - ✅ Real-time scoring with strength levels: weak → moderate → strong → very strong

  2. Advanced Pattern Detection:
  - ✅ Sequential patterns (123456, abcdef, qwerty)
  - ✅ Keyboard patterns (asdf, zxcv, yuiop)
  - ✅ Repeated characters (prevents aaa patterns)
  - ✅ Date patterns (prevents birth years, dates)
  - ✅ Personal information detection (email, name)

  3. Threat Intelligence Integration:
  - ✅ HaveIBeenPwned API Integration - Checks passwords against 600M+ breached passwords
  - ✅ k-Anonymity Protection - Only sends first 5 characters of password hash for privacy
  - ✅ Expanded Common Password Database - 30+ common passwords blocked
  - ✅ Brand/Service Pattern Detection - Prevents social media and service names

  4. User Experience Enhancements:
  - ✅ Real-time API Endpoint (/auth/check-password-strength) for live validation
  - ✅ Detailed Feedback System - Shows which requirements are met
  - ✅ Actionable Suggestions - Provides specific improvement guidance
  - ✅ Graceful Degradation - Continues if breach API is unavailable

  Integration Points:

  Authentication Routes Enhanced:
  - POST /auth/register - Full validation with breach checking
  - POST /auth/change-password - Enhanced validation for password changes
  - POST /auth/check-password-strength - Real-time validation API

  Security Middleware Applied:
  // Already integrated in secureAuth.js
  router.post('/register',
    advancedSecuritySuite.password.validate,    // Comprehensive validation
    advancedSecuritySuite.password.checkBreach, // Breach database check
    // ... rest of registration logic
  );

  Advanced Features:

  Privacy-Preserving Breach Check:
  - Uses SHA-1 hashing with k-Anonymity
  - Only sends 5-character hash prefix to API
  - Checks against 600M+ compromised passwords
  - Fails safely if API unavailable

  Intelligent Scoring System:
  // Score calculation (0-7 points)
  - Length 8+: +1 point
  - Length 12+: +1 point
  - Lowercase: +1 point
  - Uppercase: +1 point
  - Numbers: +1 point
  - Symbols: +1 point
  - Character variety (8+ unique): +1 point

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The breach checking implementation uses the industry-standard HaveIBeenPwned API with k-Anonymity, which means
  even if traffic is intercepted, the actual password cannot be determined from the API request.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  🎯 Security Hardening: 100% COMPLETE!

  | Security Feature   | Status     | Implementation                               |
